CULINARY PRINCIPLES AND FLAVOR THEORY:

1. Fundamental Flavor Elements (Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat):
   - Salt:
     * Use for flavor enhancement and seasoning development
     * Incorporate through various sources: sea salt, miso, soy sauce, capers
     * Consider timing of salt addition for optimal flavor development
     * Layer different salt sources for complexity (Ottolenghi technique)

   - Fat (Plant-Based Sources):
     * Olive oil: Mediterranean and European dishes (primary fat source)
     * Sesame oil: East Asian flavors (finishing oil)
     * Coconut oil (in moderation): South Asian and tropical dishes
     * Nut oils: For specific applications and finishing
     * Note: Be mindful of total fat intake per WHO guidelines

   - Acid:
     * Citrus: Lemon, lime (fresh), preserved lemon (Ottolenghi staple)
     * Vinegars: Rice, apple cider, balsamic, white wine
     * Fermented ingredients: Sauerkraut, pickled vegetables
     * Consider Person 2's histamine sensitivity when using fermented products
     * Use sumac and pomegranate molasses for Middle Eastern tang

   - Heat Applications:
     * Dry heat: Roasting, grilling, saut√©ing for caramelization
     * Moist heat: Steaming, braising, simmering for tenderness
     * Combined techniques: Starting with high heat for browning, finishing with gentle heat
     * High-heat roasting for vegetable char (Ottolenghi signature)

2. Ottolenghi-Inspired Flavor Building:
   - Signature Elements:
     * Bold, bright flavors
     * Multiple textures in one dish
     * Herb-forward preparations
     * Unexpected combinations
     * Visual appeal priority

   - Common Flavor Bases:
     * Garlic, olive oil, lemon
     * Fresh herbs in abundance
     * Warming spices
     * Nuts and seeds for texture
     * Pomegranate seeds for color and pop

3. Vegetarian Umami Development:
   - Primary Sources:
     * Mushrooms (fresh and dried)
     * Tomatoes (cooked for Person 2)
     * Fermented products (soy sauce, miso)
     * Nutritional yeast
     * Caramelized onions
     * Roasted garlic
     * Black garlic when available

4. Texture Building (Essential for Vegetarian Satisfaction):
   - Create Multiple Layers:
     * Crispy: Roasted chickpeas, toasted nuts, seeds, fried shallots
     * Creamy: Pureed legumes, tahini-based sauces, oat-based creams
     * Chewy: Roasted mushrooms, grains, roasted eggplant
     * Fresh: Seasonal vegetables, herbs, microgreens
     * Crunchy: Raw vegetables, toasted bread, dukkah

5. Herb and Spice Combinations:
   - Mediterranean:
     * Basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary
     * Za'atar, sumac, cumin, coriander
   - Middle Eastern:
     * Parsley, mint, dill
     * Baharat, ras el hanout, cardamom
   - Asian:
     * Cilantro, Thai basil, mint
     * Five spice, star anise, Sichuan pepper
   - Indian:
     * Curry leaves, cilantro
     * Garam masala, turmeric, cumin, coriander

6. Building Complete Vegetarian Meals:
   - Base Components:
     * Protein (legumes, tofu, tempeh)
     * Complex carbohydrates (whole grains, starchy vegetables)
     * Vegetables (cooked and raw)
     * Sauces or dressings
     * Garnishes and texture elements

   - Plating Principles:
     * Height and layers
     * Color contrast
     * Multiple textures
     * Hot and cold elements
     * Sauce presentation

7. Quick-Flavor Building (For Time-Constrained Meals):
   - Pantry Powerhouses:
     * Preserved lemon
     * Harissa
     * Dukkah
     * Chili oil
     * Prepared sauces and pastes

   - Quick Techniques:
     * High-heat roasting
     * Pan-searing
     * Quick pickles
     * No-cook sauces
     * Instant herb oils

Remember when developing recipes:
- Layer flavors for complexity
- Consider texture combinations
- Balance all taste elements
- Create visual appeal
- Plan for efficient preparation
- Include make-ahead components
- Consider seasonal adaptations
- Make dishes satisfying and complete
